# Auto Skip YT ads

Since most ad blockers are no longer working, the only way to get rid of ads on youtube is to just skip them, for those ads which cannot even be skipped the only option is to mute them to they're less annoying.

This chrome extension does this so you don't have to jump in every time (it also closes those nasty ad banners). If it fails to skip, dismiss or mute an ad you can always manully do it with a hotkey (`S`).

## Todo:

-   [x] Setup the extension for local dev
-   [x] Move to ts
-   [ ] clean up the code
-   [x] Make a quick and cheap icon
-   [ ] Publish extension in the webstore
